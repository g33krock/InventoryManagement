This file is to explain how this program works.
I brought attention to my friends my project requirements and we decided we wanted to go above and beyond.
This semester I have been studying Python and MYSQL and really wanted to write a program that integrates the two of them.
This is the product we have achieved but plan to continue to expand upon for potential use in a production state.

First in MYSQL create a database named inventory_management
CREATE DATABASE inventory_management;

In the route directory create a file called .env
in the document write MYSQL_PASSWORD="string that is your MYSQL password"
This is so that your password is secure and not in the main document

Run models.py
This will create a MYSQL database. 
From there, the program will pull from other python files to have the user enter information into the inventory_management database.

In order for the program to execute a transaction entry, you must have these requirements met:
1. Have a customer
2. Have an employee (Sales or Manager)
3. Have products in inventory



Requirements:
pymysql
sqlalchemy
python-dotenv
